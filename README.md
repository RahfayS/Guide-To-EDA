# 📌 Guide-To-EDA

## 🎯 Objective
Welcome! This notebook is designed as a **comprehensive introduction to Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**.  
We’ll cover what EDA is, why it’s essential in machine learning, and walk through many of the most commonly used EDA techniques.  

My goal is to make this notebook a **one-stop resource for beginners** who want to build a solid foundation and become proficient in EDA.

## 📝 Notes
I’d like to preface this by saying that I’m still learning EDA myself.  
This notebook is both a **learning resource for others** and a **learning journey for me**.  

If you notice any mistakes, unclear explanations, or missing details, I’d greatly appreciate feedback or suggestions for improvement. Let’s learn together! 🚀
